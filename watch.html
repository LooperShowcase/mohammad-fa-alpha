<hr />
<p>The Apple Watch 7 launched on September 14 at the Apple event alongside the iPhone 13, bringing the first redesign to Apple's smartwatch line. The Apple Watch 7 release date is set for October 15 and you can now pre-order the watch too.

  What's more we've been testing this model for over a week now, and you can read all about it in our Apple Watch 7 review.
  
  The Apple Watch 7 has a refined look that retains the rounded edges but with thinner bezels for 20% more screen area than the Apple Watch 6 – and new sizes of 41mm and 45mm. 
  
  Technically, this is the first big redesign since the Apple Watch 4 expanded to the 40mm and 44mm sizes, but it's not as drastic a redesign as we were expecting. 
  
  While rumors had us expecting a more radical redesign to a flat-edged look like the iPhone 13, we're still in round-edge territory, albeit it with even curvier glass.
  
  There also aren't any new health tracking features – it looks like we'll have to wait for next year's Apple Watch 8 for the rumored blood pressure and glucometer sensors. And while the Apple Watch 7 reportedly has a new chipset, it seems this isn't really an upgrade on the one in the Apple Watch 6.
  
  The Apple Watch 7 does get a 70% brighter always-on display while indoors, IP6X dust resistance, the same WR50 water resistance as prior models, and more durability. The battery is the same (18 hours expected, but we found around 26 hours in regular use), but recharges 33% faster. 
  
  Ultimately, the Apple Watch 7 has incremental improvements rather than revolutionary changes, but it's still the best Apple Watch you can buy</p>
